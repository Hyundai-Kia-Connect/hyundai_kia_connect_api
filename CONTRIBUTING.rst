Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `hyundai_kia_connect_api` for local development.

1. Fork the `hyundai_kia_connect_api` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/hyundai_kia_connect_api.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv hyundai_kia_connect_api
    $ cd hyundai_kia_connect_api/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8. Most
   tests require environment variables to supply the username and password and
   they will run as part of the PR pre-requisites:

    $ flake8 hyundai_kia_connect_api tests
    $ python setup.py test or pytest

   To get flake8, pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for recent Python. Check GitHub Actions checks
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

$ pytest tests.test_hyundai_kia_connect_api


Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
